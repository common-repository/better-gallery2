Requires at least: 2.5
Tested up to: 2.5.1

This plugin replaces the default gallery feature in WordPress 2.5 Lightbox/Slimbox/Greybox/Thickbox/lightview, Exif and Geo/GPS support (Google Map/Yahoo Map/MS Virtual Earth).

== Description ==

This plugin will use the same shortcode as the WP 2.5 gallery shortcode "[gallery]". So this will replace your
gallery with some extra features like:

- Extracting exif info, from Wordpress 2.5 exif info from images is stored in the database. Exif info will be display by the "boxes"
- GEO/GPS support, if your image is geotagged, a icon will appear with a geo link to flash earth.
- out of the box support for many boxes (Lightbox/Slimbox/Greybox/Thickbox), no need to install them or put them in your theme.

For help on use of the shortcode http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_gallery_shortcode

Note: this is still very beta, and there will be some bugs, I need to do some valid XHTML and code cleanup. But some people ask me to release it, and I also need some people to test it on other wp installs.
